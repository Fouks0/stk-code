# SuperTuxKart 0.9.3 - Fouks Edition

SuperTuxKart 0.9.3 with some fun mods :D !

Currently in a very early stage.

See README_Original.md for original instructions (compilation, ...). Note that some files in stk-assets need to be replaced/removed so the modded ones included in this source are used instead (will compile a list of modded file later).

## Changes from vanilla version

* Numeric speedometer (speed is in km/h)
* SuperTux difficulty is now unlocked at start, and significantly faster, matching the 200 Cc mode in Mario Kart 8!
* Item distribution. Notably, Parachutes, Basket Balls, and Item Changers are much more rare, but you will also get less bubble gums in first place in compensation (which will also indirectly punish you when you hit bananas)
* Red skidding buffed (faster and longer)
* Achievements are now longer to do

Not compatible with official speedrunning, do not submit runs using this version!

No texture/sound mods included (for now).

### Story Mode

* SuperTux difficulty is now available (races with 8 karts, beating the challenge earns you 12 points)
* Expert Required Times are harder (and take in account the huge known skips), but still doable easily by speedrunners
* Follow the Leader is still here, but unlocked with only 10 points, and there is only one opponent (plus the leader)
* In Expert and SuperTux difficulties, the final boss is not only Nolok, but an army of him!

### Planned changes

* The ability to select the kart class for each character
* Change the points repartitions for GPs races such that Triple Skips are (humanly) possible (if possible)
* Change the challenges points requirements such that at least one GP has to be done in order to be able to do the Gate Skip with the minimum number of points
* Add firehopping (... not sure)
* Add more achievements
* Add more challenges
* ...

I am not going to add a timer, but if this mod ever becomes successfull with people doing speedruns on it (i doubt it), why not.

## But why?

The new version already adds SuperTux difficulty in Story Mode, lorem ipsum blablabla...

Yeah, but the 0.9.3 is notorious by being interestingly broken. So even with more recent versions, it is likely that some people will still have some interest to play this version with its insane skips, and this mod might help them to enjoy it even more.

And personally, I just want to have fun with this :p.

I might do a 0.9.4 Fouks Edition anyway, so...
