# SuperTuxKart 0.9.3 - Fouks Edition

SuperTuxKart 0.9.3 with some fun mods :D !

Currently in a very early stage.

See README_Original.md for original instructions (compilation, ...).

## Changes from vanilla version

* Numeric speedometer
* SuperTux difficulty is now unlocked at start, and significantly faster, matching the 200 Cc mode in Mario Kart 8!
* Item distribution. Notably, Parachutes, Basket Balls, and Item Changers are much more rare

Not intended to be compatible with official speedrunning! Do not submit runs using this version!

### Story Mode

* SuperTux difficulty is now available (races with 8 karts, beating the challenge earns you 12 points)
* Expert Required Times are harder (and take in account the huge known skips), but still doable easily by speedrunners
* Follow the Leader is still here, but unlocked with only 10 points, and there is only one opponent (plus the leader)
* In Expert and SuperTux difficulties, the final boss is not only Nolok, but an army of him!
